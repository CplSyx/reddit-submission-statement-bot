# Reddit Submission Statement Bot

This is a bot for Reddit, to manage "submission statements" on posts. These require that a user submits a justification for why the post meets the requirements of the subreddit (or that a user has read the rules for example), therefore reducing spam and other non-conforming content.

The variety of configuration options is described in more detail below, however at the "default" configuration the bot will run every 5 minutes and 
- check for new posts and request a submission statement
- look at posts where the 5 minute submission statement time has expired, check if the submission statement meets the 100 character limit, and either remove or approve them based on this criteria

The bot does not operate on historical posts, and will only manage posts submitted after the bot has started.

# Installation / Operation

### Set up a Reddit account
1. [Create a new Reddit account](https://www.reddit.com/register/) with an account name suitable for the bot, e.g. "subreddit-submission-bot".

2. Login into your a Reddit account which moderates your subreddit and has the ability to invite other moderators (or ask a moderator who can), and invite the bot to become a moderator with "Manage Posts and Comments" access. 

3. Log back into the botâ€™s account and accept the invitation.

5. Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/ and select **Create an app**

6. Type a name for your app and choose **script**.

7. Write a short description of what your bot will be doing.

8. Set the `about URI` to this Github Repo URL (or any URL of your choice).

9. Set the `redirect URI` to "http://localhost:8080". 

10. Select **create app**.

11. Make note of both the client ID (the code underneath the "personal use script" subheading), and the client secret.

### Configure your hosting
1. It is assumed you will have a 24/7 available host, with a python environment. The bot will work most effectively if left running. Oracle's ["always free" tier](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) is a suitable environment to use for this bot.

2. The bot has been tested on Python 3.10.12 and PRAW 7.7.1. See: [PRAW installation](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)

3. Obtain a copy of the bot's code - either select **Code** and then **Download Zip**, or **Clone** to your host via the HTTPS URL.

### Configure the Bot
1. Open **submission-statement-bot.cfg.example**

2. Set up the configuration as needed for your subreddit (see below for configuration options)

3. Save the file as **submission-statement-bot.cfg**

### Run the Bot

1. If you are in a linux environment, usage of a [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html) is recommended.

2. Run the **submission-statement-bot.py** file in a terminal or command prompt; e.g. `python3 submission-statement-bot.py`

# Bot configuration options
